title: Profile
---

This entity contains all the profile data of a person.

The profile consists of two parts. The first is the base profile with the name, 
the avatar and the tags of the person. This part is always public and visible to
everyone. The boolean flags (`searchable`, `public` and `nsfw`) are metadata and
public too.

The second part is the extended profile consisting of `bio`, `birthday`, `gender`
and `location` is not public by default (and only visible to contacts the person
shares with). The owner of the profile can decide if this information should be
public (that's what the `public` flag is for) and then the extended profile is
visible to non-contacts too.

Because of that there is a special case where the `public`-flag is `false`, but
the profile was received via the public route. In this case the profile should
only contain the base profile.
